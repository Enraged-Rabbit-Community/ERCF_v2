## Introduction

The Enraged Rabbit Cotton Tail (ERCT) buffer system is designed to attach directly to ERCF V2. It is also designed to reduce as much resistance as possible in the filament path, creating a consistent system for calibration.

This system is also designed to reduce the buffer length, while the loops are defined by the amount of tube you use from the encoder to the tool head. This is calculated by the total Bowden tube length divided by 225. Future QoL is also in the works to allow for illuminated coupler blocks to indicate filament states.

**Features include:**

* Large central buffer wheel - reduces the filament's natural shape - each wheel comes pre-notched to make loading filament easier.
* Inline connection - connects directly to the 2020 extrusion arm
* Short Buffer Length - Can operate as short as 500mm in buffer Length
* Stackable Arm - Each arm is stackable for whatever combination of gates you want. They are optimized for strength and lightweight while providing loading and unloading filament access. More than 9 channels will require self-sourcing a metal axial rod, but printing your own up to 9 channels is available in the STL directory.
* Uses most parts from ERCP V1 -  if you already have a kit, most parts should be interchangeable.

## Acknowledgements

ERCT was designed to simplify the buffer design and integrate cleanly with ERCF, TripleDecky, Sturdy Bunny, Springy, and Binky mods. This has since evolved into the second generation and become part of ERCFv2. I thank the entire team from the ERCF V2 team. and especially Moggie, for bringing me into the team. I also have my home server, Fizzy's Tech, on Discord to thank for the countless support and hosting of the Beta development on that server. Jose from Fizzy's Tech was instrumental in this development as he was part of the system's early development and early testing. There are numerous testers who have helped as well, making suggestions throughout the beta cycle. I want to give a special shout-out to Wolffy01 and gsx8299 for their contributions to ideas, testing and mods.&#x20;

## Building the ERCT

All files are located in the STL folder, and instructions are as follows:

### **Instructions**

**PRINT SETTINGS**

.25mm first layer, .2mm Layer Height
4 Perimeters (top, bottom, walls

Arms should be printed at .2 layer height, with 4 walls and 10% lightning infill. This will significantly reduce the amount of filament used. ABS is the recommended material or PETG.

Wheels should be printed on a smooth plate, or if you use a textured plate you may need to run it on some sandpaper afterwards to avoid too much contact with the arm. There will always be a small chance of some rubbing, but with careful pressure on the hubs when installing, you shouldn't have any major resistance.

The rest of the parts can be printed with 20-30% gyroid infill.

Be careful not to go too far past the dovetail channel- it's better to be shy than to go over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The files are labelled for how many channels. They are longer than needed in case you need to put a bypass divider or extra support. Use the matching nut and work it through the acme screw to make it smooth. A brass brush can also be used to clean it up a little. It is recommended if you make more than 9 channels, to self-source a trapezoidal bar screw (also known as ACME screw). T8, Pitch 2 is a common one. You can also use a traditional screw. Make sure to get matching nuts to add to each end for those builds. |

Don't push too hard. If it doesn't go on, use a little sandpaper on the axial to reduce it. It is a tight fit but should slide on. Your pressure on the bearings will ensure the wheel is as balanced as possible. There's a very tiny bit of gap between the wheel and the side of the arm. Don't worry too much if it isn't perfect, but you can try to balance it and spin it to check.                                                                   |
