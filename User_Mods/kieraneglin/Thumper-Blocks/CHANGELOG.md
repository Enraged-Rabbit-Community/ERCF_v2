# Changelog

## Rev 3 (2023-12-15)

All parts except the latch have been modified and are not compatible with previous revisions.

- Beefed up M4 holder to prevent breakage during M4 installation
- Beefed up filament path side walls to prevent breakage during ECAS installation
- Removed 2 layers of width from the filament path to reduce the chance of rub when installed
- Updated base to support roll-in inserts for mounting to the rail
  - Also moved mounting hole just a bit
- Improved magnet fitment on filament path
- Added channel in base to improve filament feeding reliability

**UPDATE (2024-01-01)**

- Added `Thicker` variant to support ERCF v2 spec
- The original `Rev 3` is now in the `Thinner` directory
- The `filament_path` and `base` files are changed and not compatible between variants. The latch and tophat are unchanged.

## Rev 2 (2023-11-10)

- Updated tophat and filament path to use a two-landing design for the `up` vs. `down` positions. This makes the `up` position more reliable and repeatable. Don't forget to use the Springy servo arms!
- Updates some chamfers on the base (inconsequential)

## Rev 1 (2023-08-15)

Initial release!
