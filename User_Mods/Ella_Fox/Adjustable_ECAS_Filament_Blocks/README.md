# Adjustable ECAS Filament Blocks

Not all ECAS couplings are made equal. Even if you have good extrusion multipliers, some ECAS couplings can have a smaller outer diameter than expected. Whilst kits may not suffer this issue, it can be a problem if you're self-sourcing.

Try printing these modified filament path pieces if you run into issues where your ECAS coupler slips out of the housing.
