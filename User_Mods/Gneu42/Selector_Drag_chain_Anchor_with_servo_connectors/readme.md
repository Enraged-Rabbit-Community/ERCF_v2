The Servo connector will allow to very easily replace a faulty servo.
The second connector can be used to connect a second servo like a cutter mounted on the encoder.
The spacer will keep the drag chain in line with the chain end, and allow to secure the cables with a tie-wrap. It mounts between the drag chain and the the anchor.
