## Introduction

The Enraged Rabbit Cotton Tail (ERCT) buffer system is designed to attach directly to ERCF V2. It is also designed to reduce as much resistance as possible in the filament path, creating a consistent system for calibration.

This system is also designed to reduce the buffer length, while the loops are defined by the amount of tube you use from the encoder to the tool head. This is calculated by the total Bowden tube length divided by 225.  QoL features also allow for illuminated coupler blocks to indicate filament states.

**Features include:**

* Large central buffer wheel - reduces the bend radius of the filament's natural shape - each wheel comes pre-notched to make loading filament easier.
* Inline connection - connects directly to the 2020 extrusion arm
* Short Buffer Length - Can operate as short as 500mm in buffer Length
* Stackable Arm - Each arm is stackable for whatever combination of gates you want. They are optimized for strength and lightweight while providing loading and unloading filament access. More than 12 channels will require self-sourcing a metal axle rod, but printing your own up to 12 channels is available in the STL directory.
* Uses most parts from ERCP V1 -  if you already have a kit, most parts should be interchangeable.

## Acknowledgements

ERCT was designed to simplify the buffer design and integrate cleanly with ERCFv2. I thank the entire team from the ERCF V2 team, especially Moggie, for bringing me onto the team. I also have my home server, Fizzy's Tech, on Discord to thank for the countless support and hosting of the Beta development on that server. Jose from Fizzy's Tech was instrumental in this development as he was part of the system's early development and early testing. There are numerous testers who have helped as well, making suggestions throughout the beta cycle. I want to give a special shout-out to Wolffy01 and gsx8299 for their contributions to ideas, testing and mods.&#x20;

**LOADING THE BUFFER**

There are several ways to load the buffer. Use this as a reference but you may find other ways to load that is easier for you.

Try your best to work with the natural curl of the filament and feed it till you see it pop out on top.                                                                                                                      |

This will equal the number of rows you need to wrap around the wheel - maximum of 7). |

That’s it. Load it all up, and away you go!                                                                                                                                        |
