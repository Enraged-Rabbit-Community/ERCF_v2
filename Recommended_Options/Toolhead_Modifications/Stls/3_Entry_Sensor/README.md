# LGX Lite Filament Entry Sensor
This folder contains various options for filament entry detection for the LGX Lite Extruder

# Version Differnces
Flat Version - Used for all versions of the LGX Lite Extruder.

Thick Version - Used Exclusively for the LGX Lite Extruder v1. This version is reinforced where the filament sensor meets the front plate of the extruder, increasing rigidity. This MIGHT help with resonances.

# BOM

You will need the following:
1. 1x ECAS Fitting (Standard Voron Spec)
2. 2x M2x10 Self Tapping Screws (M2x8 will likely work)
3. 1x 5.5mm Ball Bearing (Standard Voron Spec - Same ball bearing used in other Tool Heads)
4. 1x Microswitch (Tested with Omron D2F, but generic should work. Remove the lever)
5. 2x M3x30 Screws (BHCS/SHCS)
5. Misc amounts of Wire + Connectors + Solder

# Print Settings

Standard Voron Print Settings

# Post Processing

Ensure that filament passes without any friction along the filament path

# Instructions

1. Prepare Microswitch by soldering on wire leads. I reccomend Normally Closed
2. Press Fit ECAS Fitting into printed part. Ensure that the housing does not crack when doing this
3. Add ball bearing into pocket
4. Screw in Microswitch with actuator toward ball bearing
5. Test with filament that the ball bearing actuates (you should hear a click)
6. If you haven't already, remove stock ptfe fitting and store in a safe location
7. Secure completed housing onto the extruder by removing stock screws and replacing with M3x30.
