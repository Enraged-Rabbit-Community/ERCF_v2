## <img src="https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder/Assets/Filamentalist_Brain_Logo.png" width="50" height="60"> Theory of operation:

The Filamentalist is an integrated solution for buffering and spool holding providing space savings as well as the potential for filament path reduction and the associated drag/resistance that comes with long runs from spool to buffer to MMU.

- The Filamentalist uses the axial force delivered by the MMU gear motor along the filament to load and unload to and from the filament spool.
- An adjustable spring clamp forces the filament against two o-rings that sit on the drive pulley to create a high traction interface for rotating the axle and filament spool.
- A one-way clutch style bearing locks against the drive shaft and rotates the filament spool to take up filament during an unload.
- For loading and print extruding, the clutch disengages allowing for effective free-spooling of the filament spool similar to a roller style spool holder.
- The difference in diameter of the filament driven clutched roller versus the larger roller that the filament spool sits on provides the needed gear ratio to produce enough rotations to take up, and unload a nearly empty or full filament roll.
- During unloading/buffering, to account for the varying diameter of a spool from full to empty filament tension will cause the spring loaded arm to lift a small amount and release traction from the o-rings allowing slip to occur between the filament and the o-ring interface of the rewinder (full spool = max slip, empty spool = no/minimal slip).

Discord user Thisiscam first made me aware of [Muzi Xiaoyang's video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ZM41197fX/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click) of a filament driven rewinder .  Through a long collaboration with Thisiscam, a great Beta dev/test team, and many design iterations/improvements on the Muzi Xiaoyang design, the Filamentalist was born. Key changes to the Muzi Xiaoyang design include incorporation of a one-way bearing, establishing the correct gear ratio for operation across the range of empty-to-full spools, and the long-life o-ring based filament clamping interface.

A special mention and thanks goes out to Cheesefrog and JCPhlux for their innovation and inputs for design refinement. 

## <img src="https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder/Assets/Filamentalist_Brain_Logo.png" width="50" height="60"> **Additional Notes/Considerations** 

Things that you need to know include:
1. Due to continual evolution of the design based on user feedback, the pictures in this guide may not reflect the most current design.  They will be similar and generally represent the latest parts and assemblies .  The part names in the Printing Guidelines below will be kept current to match the CAD/STL files.
2. There are multiple options for the Filamentalist.  Determine which versions/options you want and select the stl's to print accordingly.
   - Unit Width: 80mm, 100mm, and custom width via Fusion 360 parametric model
     -  80mm - Designed around 80mm long off-the-shelf 8mm axles.  This standard version maximizes space efficiency with common spool size compatibility, accomodating spool widths up to 68mm.  Total rewinder width is 81.5mm allowing 6 units across the top of a 350 Voron mounted on 500mm extrusions.
     -  100mm - Designed around 100mm long off-the-shelf 8mm axles.  This size accomodates spool widths up to 86.5mm (basically all brands of 1kg spools).  Total rewinder width is 100mm.
     -  Parametric Model - If you use Autodesk Fusion 360 you can adjust the design for virtually any realistic spool width and axle size.  You can also "push" the design a bit using an acceptable axle "underhang" to get more spool width.  For example you can effectively accomodate a spool width of 72mm (KVP, NinjaFlex) on the 80mm axle with an underhang value of -2.75mm.  With this underhang the axle is still fully captured by the 608 bearings.  You could even push this further to an underhang of -5.75mm to get a max spool width of 78mm and still have acceptable axle engagement with the 608 bearings.
   - Mounting Style: Standard (shelf) mount, 2020 rail clip-in mount, 2020 clip-in mount for Filamentalist Enclosure
       - Based on your mounting needs, you may or may not need to print and install the Base Plate part.  It is really only needed if you don't plan to attach the rewinder to a surface.
   - Feed Direction: The orientation of your MMU with respect to your filament spools location may require a front, rear, or bottom loading capability from the
       rewinder.  Tensioner Mount options are provided to support this.
   - Pre-gate Sensors: If your MMU does not have pre-gate sensors and the software you use supports them (like Happy Hare) there are Tensioner Mount options that  support this.
3. If you're using, or upgrading from a ERCFv1 or v2 RC1A version you may want/need a higher torque gear motor.  Many in the Beta team ran NEMA 17's spec'd at 55 N-cm max torque and config'd them for 1-1.5A (probably overkill...).  Grafton's [40 Tooth NEMA 17 Mod](https://www.printables.com/model/692720-ercf-40-tooth-gear-modifiction) is a good addition for gaining more speed from a high torque motor.  This may not be required so if you already have built your ERCF, try the Filamentalist with the motor/gearing you have and decide if you think you need more torque/speed.
4. One baseline width of the Filamentalist is set to use a 80mm axle length.  It has a maximum spool width of 68mm and supports most standard 1, 0.5, and 0.25KG spool sizes and still be able to fit 6 rewinders across the top of a 350 size Voron printer. Height was set to be as low as possible to fit some existing dry box designs although there is the possibility to make user modifications to to reduce height further if needed. Some spools such as NinjaFlexand KVP's are too wide to fit the 80mm design.  If you use spools wider than 68mm there is also step and stl files posted for a 100mm axle length version. If you are using Autodesk Fusion 360 the provided .f3d file in the CAD directory is a parametric based model allowing you to customize the width of your rewinder to suit your max/min spool widths and/or to design around a standard available steel axle length (see instructions here  [parametric_model](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder/CAD/readme.md) ). 
5. Because the standard tuning of this design relies on some filament slip at the o-rings, the o-rings may ultimately wear-out.  Testing and extrapolation estimates that the wear-out point is ~5K cycles. See the O-Ring Replacement section at the end of this document for o-ring swap/replacement instructions. 
6. Due to pressfits for the 608 bearings and ECAS fitting printer calibration is important.  A "Test Block" stl is included.  It is recommended you print this first and test the press fits and measure the two small holes (2.7mm for cutting 3mm screw threads and 2.3mm for the filament path) to determine if you need to apply any scaling or changes to your extrusion factors in your slicer before printing.  Due to varying ECAS supplier tolerances and varying printer tolerances some experienced cracking at the ECAS hole when pressing in the ECAS.  If all other press fits work well on the Test Block but you experience cracking at the ECAS hole when pressing in an ECAS fitting, you can use an Xacto knife to lightly remove some plastic from the ECAS hole.  If the ECAS is too loose you can use superglue to glue the ECAS into the Tensioner Mount (not the Test Block 😉 ).

## <img src="https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder/Assets/Filamentalist_Brain_Logo.png" width="50" height="60"> Printing Guidelines:

## **General:**
- Material: ABS or ASA (~170 gm per site)
- Print Time: ~8hr 17min (based on the Ellis PIF profile speeds, accelerations, and volumes)
- 0.2mm layer height
- 40% infill recommended.  Linear style infills are fastest (rectilinear, monotonic, grid, triangles, stars, etc.)
- Wall Count: 4
- Solid Top/Bottom Layers: 5

## **Part Specific:**
- Orientation suggestions are relative to the installed assembly orientation and are shown in the slicer images below.
- There are stls for both 80mm and 100mm wide version and a Fusion 360 parametric CAD model for additional custom widths.  See "Additional Notes/Considerations" point 3 above for more details.
- If rotating the Filamentalist is not feasible for your required filament loading direction or you need a bottom feed capability (for example enclosure limitations or feeding through the bottom of a shelf) there is an option for a rear loading version which only requires printing the Tensioner_Mount_Rear_Load_80mm/100mm_[option] in the place of Tensioner_Mount_80mm/100mm part.

- Stl's are provided for optional clip-in style supports where no Base_Plate is needed and the rewinders are easily clipped in and out of (2) 2020 extrusions mounted 170mm center-to-center apart.  This option is highly recommeded if your setup can accomodate this style type of mount.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder/Assets/Clip-In_Supports.jpg" width="250" height="175">
- **!! IMPORTANT !!  This design relies on multiple press-fits for bearings and ECAS fittings.  As a result, printer calibration is important.  A Test_Block stl is included.  It is highly recommended that you print this block first, check fits, and make adjustments to extrusion multipliers and/or slicer scaling if needed before printing the Filamentalist parts.**

Tune by setting the Tensioner Arm clamping force.  The arm does not need an extreme amount of tension.  To tune the spring force, lift the tensioner and insert a section of filament through the o-ring bearing interface and into the bowden tube.  Hold the center roller by placing your thumb against the o-rings and try to pull the filament out.  You want the slip force to be slightly more than what the overall system drag is, so you have to imagine the range of gear motor pull force vs rewinder drag and set a slip range in-between the two "imaginary" lines.  Adjust the spring tensioner screw accordingly and err on the light side.  Run the rewinder (see test code below). If loose filament is forming around the filament spool during unload, tighten the spring tensioning screw.  If no loose filament is forming around the filament roll, gradually reduce the spring tension until loose filament starts to accumulate and then increase tension in ~1/2 screw turn increments until you feel you have the lightest tension that results in a tightly packed unload.

You may never need to replace o-rings.  Testing and extrapolation estimates that the wear-out point is ~5K cycles.  The impact of o-ring wear-out can be reduced by periodically swapping highly used rewinders with low use rewinders in your line-up.  Also, o-rings with grooves worn in them can be swapped with their opposing partners to present the unworn side/face to the filament to extend the life of a set.  For o-ring replacement, remove the Drive Roller Assembly from the rewinder (unscrew the (6) screws of the Right and Left Supports).  Then unscrew the set screw on one Rim Roller.  You can now slide the CDR Spacer and Center Drive Roller from the axle, remove the old o-rings (a dental pic works great), and install a pair of new ones.  Reinstall the Center Drive Roller and CDR Spacer back on the axle and install the Rim Roller back onto the axle per 3.3 above, and re-install the supports.

Below are macros you can cut and paste into the bottom of your mmu_software.cfg or printer.cfg to test and tune your rewinders.

Happy multi-material printing and rewindering!

Versioning convention.  V"X"."Y"."Z"
- "X" represents a major change in form, fit, or function.  An increment in "X" may not require that existing built units undergo rework but the new parts will generally not be compatible with past version rewinders.
- "Y" represents a "step rev" or minor revision.  These are generally small "tweaks" for improved functionality, useability, and/or assembly and typically would not require reprint/rework for existing rewinders.  
- "Z" represents a backwards compatible "bug fix".  This will generally be addressing nuisance CAD or printability issues.

V1 - 5/17/24 - Public release into ERCF V2 RC2 repository

V1.1 - 5/19/24 - Update to CAD and stls for Tensioner Arms to remove potential filament catching point during endless spool ejection

V1.2 - 5/20/24 - Reverted Center_Drive_Roller to cylindrical press fit hole (vs hex of V1 and V1.1).  Revised 608 press fit pockets of Idler_Roller_(male&female) parts for both 80mm and 100mm width versions for improved press fit.

V1.3 - 5/20/24 - Added bevel to internal step on  Idler_Roller_(male) part for 80mm and 100mm versions to improve printability.  Updated the .f3dparametric file, step files, and stls for 80mm and 100mm versions.
