## Troubleshooting
- If you have built the Filamentalist(s) and are having issues with its functioning such as loose loops or gear motor stalling please refer to this [Trouble Shooting Guide](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/rc2/Recommended_Options/Filamentalist_Rewinder/troubleshoot.md).  If this doesn't help to resolve your questions you can get help from the many great users at the Filamentalist Discord server here (https://discord.gg/uDcGxukRKd)

  ### CheeseFrog's
  https://github.com/juliusjj25/ERCF-Pregate-Sensors

  This is what SkiBikePrint uses (SkiBikeMake on Discord).  It is simple and works great.  It requires the "bumped" lever style Omron D2F microswitches.  Great for a new build.  Retrofitting this onto an existing ERCF requires a tear down of the unit to replace the filament path portion of the blocks as well as the latches.  I did it the brute force way and trimmed my existing latches back with clippers and "muscled" the filament path parts out and back in to the blocks.  The brute force approach may not be for everyone!

  ### Gneu's Filament Block 
  https://github.com/gneu42/Triple-Decky/tree/main/STL/ERCF-V2/Rev_C/Rev_C9/Optional%20Pre-gate%20Sensor%20(Experimental)

  Similar to the CheeseFrog solution but more complex.  Also requires a teardown/rebuild if added to an existing ERCF.

## Enclosure Solutions

  ### Filamentalist Enclosure

  An elegant passive enclosure/dry box (no heaters or fans) designed to house the Filamentalist passive rewinder.  It is great for a 4-6 channel ERCF (can go to higher channels if desired).  It consists of (4) printed endcaps, (6) pieces of 2020 extrusion cut/ordered to the desired length, and 0.060" (1/16') polycarbonate sheet(s) cut to size.  Details and files here:  https://github.com/SkiBikePrint/ERCF_Mods/tree/main/Filamentalist_Enclosure

  ### (Un)original Prusa Drybox

  Box is available here:  https://www.printables.com/model/551828-unoriginal-prusa-drybox .  Delete the rollers and add your own Filamentalist mounting solution.  You may need the rear load option for the Filamentalist

  ### Fysetc Drybox Enclosure Kit

  Kit is available on Aliexpress including links to CAD/stl files and assembly instructions:  https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806921054513.html. Delete existing spool roller solution and modify for Filamentalist mounting.  Contact SkiBikePrint (SkiBikeMake on Discord) for modified stl's that capture 2020 rails for use with the Filamentalist clip-in style mount.
