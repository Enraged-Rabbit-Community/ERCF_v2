## Changes and Improvements

- Use M3 insert nut and add 623 bearing(2ea)

Improved convenience

- Designed part size so that it can be printed on a 180x180 size bed.

- Hole on the front to check the condition of the O-ring

- Can be replaced with wider wheels to accommodate wider spools (Wheels of various widths, fixed and released with 2 bolts)

- It uses the spring used in a typical ballpoint pen.
